#1 - logarithmic loop with space O(1) and time O(logn)
#2 - logarithmic with Space O(1) and time O(sqrtn)
#3 - constant as inner one loops to 10, so space O(1) and time O(n)

Main Challenge:
unit of work is the incrementing of the count
inner loop depends on the outer loop so those two are triangular ones.
But outer is logarithmic which means O(logn), then the inner will be executed i times each time which is linear - O(n)
Overall: space is O(1) for the count and n and time is O(nlogn)

C1 - linear * logarithmic => time O(nlogn)
C2 - logarithmic => O(logn)
C3 - linear * logarithmic => time O(n*sqrtn)
C4 - O(logn^2)
C5 - linear -=> O(n)

Reflection: Big-O stands for the heavy lifting and the amount of work needed, not about the repetitions
